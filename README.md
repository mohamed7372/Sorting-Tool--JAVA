# Sorting-Tool--JAVA
In the modern world, data has become so abundant that processing it is not easy. How can anyone understand all these words and numbers? In this project, I have written a program that processes and categorizes text and digital data. The program will be able to identify the largest or most frequent pieces of data and perform the necessary calculations on it. Data waiting to be sorted!
